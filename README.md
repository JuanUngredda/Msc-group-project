# Msc-group-project
In this project we use a variant of Evolutionary Algorithm called the Rolling Tide Evolutionary Algorithm
(RTEA)[1]. This method enhances accuracy of elite solutions (non-dominated solutions)
whilst not spending a lot of the computational budget for re-evaluating all samples
contained in the archive. 



# Files

## RTEA.py

Contains all code to do with simulators, optimiser, and description of their their parameters.

## RTEA.ipynb

Jupyter notebook showing the main function callings and expected outputs from the function in the display.
